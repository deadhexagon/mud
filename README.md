# MUD PROJECT

This is a simple MUD (multi-user dungeon) written in C++

## Building

To build this project, change to the project's root directory, then run the following:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .

If everything was successful, you should now have a **Makefile**. Then you can run:

    make

Again, if everything was good, you'll now have an executable named **mud** in the project root.
