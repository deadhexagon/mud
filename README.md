# MUD PROJECT

## Building

To build this project, change to the project's root directory, then run the following:

    `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .`

If everything was successful, you should now have a **Makefile**. Then you can run:

    `make`

Again, if everything was good, you'll now have an executable named **mud** in the project root.
